# Plant-s_Leaf_counting_using_VGG16

## Dataset (Leaf counting dataset):

Description: The dataset is plant images at different resolutions captured with a variety of cameras. There are images showing plants with approximatelty 1,2,3,4 and 6 leafs. The images are part of a Leaf counting dataset which can be downloaded from the Aarhus University, Denmark.
Link to download: you can download the dataset from the original website here [Original data](https://vision.eng.au.dk/leaf-counting-dataset/)

you can download the splitted folders for train and test from here [Splitted version](https://vision.eng.au.dk/leaf-counting-dataset/).


** both regularization and augmentation helped the model to generalize better and reduced the overfitting, as the augmentation helped to increase the small size of the training set, and the regularization prevent the model's weight from overfitting.
